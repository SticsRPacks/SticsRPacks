## Introduction

### The SticsRpacks packages

SticsRPacks is a set of packages for managing the STICS soil-crop model from R.

It includes 4 packages:

-   SticsRFiles: to manipulate STICS input and output files,
-   SticsOnR: to run STICS simulations,
-   CroPlotR: to plot models results / observations and compute stats,
-   CroptimizR: to estimate model parameters.

SticsRFiles and SticsOnR are dedicated to the STICS model, while CroPlotR and CroptimizR are generic for crop models (i.e. they can be used with any crop model that has an adequate R wrapper).

The websites of the different packages can be found at:

-   <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/>
-   <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsOnR/>
-   <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/>
-   <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/>

### Finding documentation about the packages and their functions

There are different sources of documentation regarding the packages and their functions:

-   the home pages of the packages websites (which links are given here-before), that introduce the packages main features,
-   the vignettes (`Articles` tab at the top of the packages websites home pages), that describe in detail the main features of the packages and the use of the associated functions,
-   the `Reference` tab at the top of the packages websites home pages, that lists and quickly describes all the exported functions of the packages, and gives links to their detailed documentation,
-   the command `? functionName` in the R console, which displays the detailed documentation of a given function.

Note also that completion can be used to list the different arguments of a function: if you type the name of a function in the R console followed by a bracket, e.g. `read.csv(` and then click on the `Tab` button of your keyboard, the list of arguments of the function will be displayed.

### The SticsRpacks tutorial

#### Principle 

This tutorial aims at introducing the use of these different packages with the STICS model.

It was designed to be of increasing complexity, it is thus advised to follow it in order. The different sections are however independent and you can thus start it from any part using the menu on the left side (this may however take a little while since results from previous exercises must be automatically generated in this case).

The names and documentation of the functions to be used are given in the first exercises before letting you find them on your own as you go through the exercises.

Most of the exercises in the tutorial requires writing and running a few lines of R code through R console panels like this one:

```{r test, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r test-hint-1}
# This is the first advise!
```

```{r test-solution}
# Here's the SOLUTION:
get_var_info(keyword = "root")
```

You just have to type the R code in the black part and click on the `Run Code` green button on the right side to run it.
The results will be printed below the panel.
You can use these panels to do whatever tests you want to do to explore the features of the packages.

The `Start over` button re-initialize the panel.

If you don't find the solution, click on the button `Hints`, it will give you an advice.
If you click again and again several advises will be given (depending on the exercise) and finally the expected solution of the exercise.
To copy the solution in the panel, click on the `Copy to Clipboard` blue button on the right and then right-click in the black part of the panel and select "paste".
You can train on the panel above.

🔍 means that The section or exercise explores a specific aspect in more detail. You can skip it if you're short on time. 😉


#### STICS version used

::: {.alert .alert-info}
If this tutorial is run locally on your computer and that you have already installed a version of STICS (more recent or equal to 9.2.0), it is recommended that you use this version to run the tutorial exercises. 

For this, an environment variable `javastics_path` must be set to the path of the corresponding JavaSTICS folder.
This can be done:

* in your R session, each time before running the tutorial, by executing the following command:  `Sys.setenv(javastics_path="path_to_JavaSTICS”)`, where path_to_JavaSTICS should be replaced by the absolute path of the corresponding JavaSTICS folder.

or 

* by defining this environment variable in your .Renviron file: edit this file (located in your Home directory - linux OS, or Document folder - Windows OS, can be edited also using `usethis::edit_r_environ()`), and add a new line javastics_path="path_to_JavaSTICS”.


Your R session must then be restarted in any case (in RStudio: menu Session-> Restart R).

Also, restart the tutorial using `learnr::run_tutorial("SticsRpacks", package="SticsRPacks", clean=TRUE)`.

If you do not set the environment variable `javastics_path`, the tutorial will automatically download JavaStics to a temporary folder on your computer: `r work_dir`. 

However, this takes more time and disk space, and antiviruses sometimes block the run of the STICS executable when it is located in such temporary folder, which is why the use of a locally installed JavaStics distribution is recommended.
:::

For this session, the JavaSTICS distribution used is `r javastics_path`. This path is stored in the R object `javastics_path` in the context of this tutorial. 

The exercises of the tutorial will use the USMs defined in the "example" workspace of JavaStics.
The path of this workspace is stored in the R object `workspace_path` in the context of this tutorial.
For this session this path is `r workspace_path`.

**WARNING: The `javastics_path` and `workspace_path` values printed above may be incorrect if you have redefined the `javastics_path` environment variable and restarted the tutorial by clicking on the "Start Tutorial" button in RStudio, or by running `learnr::run_tutorial("SticsRpacks", package="SticsRPacks")`. In this case, prefer run the tutorial by using `learnr::run_tutorial("SticsRpacks", package="SticsRPacks", clean=TRUE)`.**

## A foretaste of SticsRpacks

```{=html}
<!-- Note : indications might be added about some technical tips: for example some parts may take some time
if they are not followed along the right order, needs for example to run simulations before exploiting outputs ... in part **Exploring and Evaluating the STICS results** -->
```
Let see first the possibilities offered by the SticsRPacks packages through two simple illustrative examples.
At this stage it is not necessary to understand the code, the aim in this section is just to show you what we can do with a few lines of R codes, you will learn how to use all the functions used here in the next sections :-).
If you feel lost in this section or are hurry to start learning how to use the packages you can skip it and go to the next one!

### STICS training Practical session PW1

The practical sessions of the STICS training were traditionally performed using the JavaStics GUI and Excel.

Let's see how the first sessions would look like in R using SticsRPacks.

The game is to run a single USM by activating and deactivating water and nitrogen stress in turns and to analyze the impact by looking at dynamic variables and stress indicators.

Let's first initialize variables and define the setup:

```{r PW1-display-setup, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Let's define the USM and variables of interest to use in this example
usm_name <- "maize_ref_2013"
stress_ind_names <- c(
  "turfac1moy", "turfac2moy", "swfac1moy", "swfac2moy",
  "inn1moy", "inn2moy"
)
dyn_var_names <- c("lai_n", "zrac", "resmes", "azomes", "QNplante", "masec_n")
var_names <- c(stress_ind_names, dyn_var_names)

# Set-up the simulation environment:
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
  javastics = javastics_path,
  workspace = workspace_PW1
)

# Generate the files for the simulation:
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_PW1, usm = usm_name)
```

```{r PW1-linux-setup, echo=FALSE, eval=knitr::opts_chunk$get("linux"), message=FALSE}

# Let's define the USM and variables of interest to use in this example
usm_name <- "maize_ref_2013"
stress_ind_names <- c(
  "turfac1moy", "turfac2moy", "swfac1moy", "swfac2moy",
  "inn1moy", "inn2moy"
)
dyn_var_names <- c("lai_n", "zrac", "resmes", "azomes", "QNplante", "masec_n")
var_names <- c(stress_ind_names, dyn_var_names)

# stop("debug", javastics_path)

# Set-up the simulation environment:
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
  javastics = javastics_path,
  workspace = workspace_PW1
)



# Generate the files for the simulation:
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_PW1,
  usm = usm_name,
  java_cmd = knitr::opts_chunk$get("java_cmd")
)
```

```{r PW1-setup, echo=FALSE, eval=knitr::opts_chunk$get("windows"), message=FALSE}

# Let's define the USM and variables of interest to use in this example
usm_name <- "maize_ref_2013"
stress_ind_names <- c(
  "turfac1moy", "turfac2moy", "swfac1moy", "swfac2moy",
  "inn1moy", "inn2moy"
)
dyn_var_names <- c("lai_n", "zrac", "resmes", "azomes", "QNplante", "masec_n")
var_names <- c(stress_ind_names, dyn_var_names)

# Set-up the simulation environment:
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_PW1)

# Generate the files for the simulation:
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_PW1, usm = usm_name)
```

Note that, in case you would like to reproduce this example, the JavaStics and workspace paths used here are:

```{r PW1-print-path, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Print the path to JavaSTICS and to the workspace used
# (same paths can be used if you want to reproduce this example)
print(paste("javastics_path = ", javastics_path))
print(paste("workspace_PW1 = ", workspace_PW1))
```

Then, let's run the simulations for the different configurations:

```{r PW1-sim-config, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Simulate a reference situation with water and nitrogen stress
sim_ws_ns <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  param_values = c(codeinnact = 1, codeh2oact = 1),
  var = var_names
)$sim_list

# Simulate with water stress only
sim_ws <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  param_values = c(codeinnact = 2),
  var = var_names
)$sim_list

# Simulate with N stress only
sim_ns <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  param_values = c(codeh2oact = 2),
  var = var_names
)$sim_list

# Simulate with water stress only
sim_without_stress <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  param_values = c(codeinnact = 2, codeh2oact = 2),
  var = var_names
)$sim_list
```

Now we can use the simulated results to plot the dynamic variables of interest for the different configurations:

```{r PW1-plot-dyn, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p <- plot(sim_ws_ns = sim_ws_ns, sim_ws = sim_ws, sim_ns = sim_ns, sim_without_stress = sim_without_stress, var = dyn_var_names)
print(p)
```

Finally, we can plot the stress indicators averaged over vegetative and reproductive phases:

```{r PW1-plot-stress, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Get the final values
df <- CroPlotR::bind_rows(
  sim_ws_ns[[usm_name]] %>% summarise(across(.cols = stress_ind_names, last)) %>%
    bind_cols(Case = "sim_ws_ns"),
  sim_ws[[usm_name]] %>% summarise(across(.cols = stress_ind_names, last)) %>%
    bind_cols(Case = "sim_ws"),
  sim_ns[[usm_name]] %>% summarise(across(.cols = stress_ind_names, last)) %>%
    bind_cols(Case = "sim_ns"),
  sim_without_stress[[usm_name]] %>% summarise(across(.cols = stress_ind_names, last)) %>%
    bind_cols(Case = "sim_without_stress")
)

# Plot bar graph with ggplot ... sorry, not yet available using CroPlotR ...
df_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(df, stress_ind_names, names_to = "variables")
p <- ggplot(df_long, aes(fill = Case, y = value, x = variables)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")
print(p)
```

... and let the users interpret these results!

The last part may not be straightforward for R newcomers ... however a function to filter values of simulated variables at given dates and/or stages will hopefully come soon :-).

### Parameter optimization: A simple example

Here is an example use-case of optimizing the `stamflax` parameter for a wheat crop using observations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) for one situation (*i.e.* one USM).
The following figure shows the daily simulations of LAI using a default value for the `stamflax` parameter, those using the value after optimization, and the observations used for the optimization:

```{r param-estim-stamflax, paged.print=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/master/inst/tutorials/SticsRpacks/optim_stamflax_wheat.png")
```

The code to perform this optimization and generate this figure is the following:

```{r simple-example-param-estim, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
usm <- "wheat"

# First, import the observations and filter them:
obs <- get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = usm)
obs_filt <- filter_obs(obs, "lai_n", include = TRUE)

# Set-up the simulation environment:
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE)
optim_options <- list(nb_rep = 3, out_dir = workspace_path)

# Define the parameter to optimize and the boundary values:
param_info <- list(stamflax = list(lb = 200, ub = 400))

# Generate the files for the simulation:
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usm = usm)

# Make the optimization:
optim_res <- estim_param(
  obs_list = obs_filt,
  model_function = stics_wrapper,
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  optim_options = optim_options,
  param_info = param_info
)

# Import the results before/after the simulation and plot them on the same figure:
sim_after_optim <- stics_wrapper(param_values = optim_res$final_values, model_options = wrapper_options)$sim_list
sim_before_optim <- stics_wrapper(model_options = wrapper_options)$sim_list

p <- plot(after = sim_after_optim, before = sim_before_optim, obs = obs_filt, var = "lai_n")
print(p)
```

Note that, in case you would like to reproduce this example, the JavaStics and workspace paths used in this example are:

```{r simple-example-print-path, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Print the path to JavaSTICS and to the workspace used
# (same paths can be used if you want to reproduce this example)
print(paste("javastics_path = ", javastics_path))
print(paste("workspace_path = ", workspace_path))
```

A lot is happening here!

But don't worry if you don't understand anything, you'll learn everything you need to know in this tutorial.
We just want you to see that you can make a parameter optimization with less than 30 lines of code, including the plots of the improvement of the resulting simulated variable of interest against observations.
And the good news is when you understand these lines of code, you'll be able to do almost anything with the packages, because it doesn't get any longer or more complex than this.

OK now that we saw what we can do, let's find out how step by step.

## Finding names of STICS variables

Names of STICS variables can be retrieved from partial name or keywords using the `get_var_info` function of the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html).

Here's its description as given in the R help panel (`? get_var_info`) and the [SticsRFiles package website](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/reference/get_var_info.html):

<blockquote>

```{r get_var_info-help, results="asis"}
lines <- SticsRFiles:::get_from_help(file.path(help_dir, "get_var_info.html"))
cat(paste(lines, collapse = "\n"))
```

</blockquote>

-   Find all STICS variables related to roots

```{r get_var_info1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_var_info1-hint-1}
# Use argument keyword="root"!
```

```{r get_var_info1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
get_var_info(keyword = "root")
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
See also: `get_param_info`, a function for retrieving name and information on STICS parameters.
:::

## Exploring the content of the JavaStics files

We're going to see in this section how to retrieve information from JavaStics input files.

### Get usm names

The function `get_usms_list` from the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html) returns the list of USMs included in a usms.xml file.

Here's its description as given in the R help panel (`? get_usms_list`) and on the [SticsRFiles package website](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/reference/get_usms_list.html):

<blockquote>

```{r get_usms_list-help, results="asis"}
lines <- SticsRFiles:::get_from_help(file.path(help_dir, "get_usms_list.html"))
cat(paste(lines, collapse = "\n"))
```

</blockquote>

-   You will use in the following the `get_usms_list` function to get the list of USMs included in the "example" workspace of the JavaStics distribution installed by this tutorial. The path to this workspace is stored in the R object `workspace_path` (**be careful**, do not confuse the path of the JavaStics example workspace, stored in the R object `workspace_path`, and the path of the examples of the SticsRFiles package, retrieved using the `get_examples_path` function in the function documentation displayed above!).

First, display the path of the JavaStics "example" workspace, and list its content using the `list.files` function:

```{r view_ls_workspace, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r view_ls_workspace-hint-1}
# print the object workspace_path to display the path
```

```{r view_ls_workspace-hint-2}
# apply the list.files function to workspace_path for listing its files
```

```{r view_ls_workspace-solution}
print(workspace_path)

list.files(workspace_path)
```

Now, display the list of USMs defined in the workspace `workspace_path`

```{r get_usms_list1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_usms_list1-hint-1}
# Use the file.path function to build full path to a file from directory names and filenames: file.path(path,filename)
```

```{r get_usms_list1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
get_usms_list(file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml"))
```


-   Get the list of cover-crops USMs (their name starts with `"cc_"`).

```{r get_usms_list2, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_usms_list2-hint-1}
# The argument "usm" is particularly useful in this case ...
```

```{r get_usms_list2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
get_usms_list(file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml"), usm = "cc_")
```

### Get parameters values from JavaStics input files

Parameters values included in JavaStics input files can be retrieved using the function `get_param_xml` from the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html):

<blockquote>

```{r get_param_xml-help, results="asis"}
lines <- SticsRFiles:::get_from_help(file.path(help_dir, "get_param_xml.html"))
cat(paste(lines, collapse = "\n"))
```

</blockquote>

-   Get the values of clay content after decarbonation (argi) for all soils defined in the `sols.xml` file of the `workspace_path` workspace of the JavaStics distribution.

```{r get_param_xml1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_param_xml1-hint-1}
# The path of the "sols.xml" file of the JavaStics example folder can be defined using the function file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml")
```

```{r get_param_xml1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
get_param_xml(file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml"), c("argi"))
```

```{r get_param_xml2-setup}
result <- get_param_xml(file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml"), c("argi"))
```

-   Knowing that the result of the previous exercise has been stored in an R object called `result`, plot an histogram of the values of argi.

```{r get_param_xml2, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_param_xml2-hint-1}
# Use the hist function to plot an histogram
```

```{r get_param_xml2-hint-2}

```

```{r get_param_xml2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
hist(result$sols.xml$argi)
```

- 🔍 Compute the Available Water Capacity of fine earth for soil `"solmais"` in mm. The equation is `AWC=sum((HCCF-HMINF)*epc*DAF/10)`, where `HCCF` is the vector of STICS parameters for field capacity of the different soil layers, `HMINF` for wilting point, `epc` for thickness, `DAF` for soil density, and sum is over the different layers.

```{r get_param_xml3, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_param_xml3-hint-1}
# Use select and value arguments of get_param_xml to extract information for a given soil
```

```{r get_param_xml3-solution}
# SOLUTION:
result <- get_param_xml(file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml"), c("HCCF", "HMINF", "epc", "DAF"), select = "sol", select_value = "solmais")
sum((result$sols.xml$HCCF - result$sols.xml$HMINF) * result$sols.xml$epc * result$sols.xml$DAF / 10)
```

### Get weather variables

Weather variables defined in STICS input weather files can be retrieved using the function `get_climate_txt` from the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html):

<blockquote>

```{r get_climate_txt-help, results="asis"}
lines <- SticsRFiles:::get_from_help(file.path(help_dir, "get_climate_txt.html"))
cat(paste(lines, collapse = "\n"))
```

</blockquote>

-   Compute the total amount of precipitation that has fallen in Auzeville in 2013 from the file `"Auzeville.2013"` of the JavaStics Example workspace.

```{r get_climate_txt1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_climate_txt1-hint-1}
# Precipitation is stored in the column named ttrr
```

```{r get_climate_txt1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
result <- get_climate_txt(workspace = workspace_path, file_name = "Auzeville.2013")
sum(result$ttrr)
```

- 🔍 Compute the amount of precipitation that has fallen between dates `"2013-03-21"` and `"2013-09-20"` using the `result` R object containing the data of the `"Auzeville.2013"` file.

```{r prepare-get_climate}
file_path <- file.path(tmp_dir, "climate.RData")
if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
  result <- get_climate_txt(workspace = workspace_path, file_name = "Auzeville.2013")
  save("result", file = file_path)
} else {
  load(file = file_path)
}
```

```{r get_climate_txt2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_climate"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_climate_txt2-hint-1}
# Use dplyr::filter(result,Date>"2013-03-21", Date<"2013-09-20") to filter the results wrt the Dates.
```

```{r get_climate_txt2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
filtered_result <- dplyr::filter(result, Date > "2013-03-21", Date < "2013-09-20")
sum(filtered_result$ttrr)
```

## Running simulations from R

Let see now how to run STICS simulations directly from R using the function `run_javastics` from the [SticsOnR package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsOnR/index.html).

From now on we will no longer display function help in the tutorial.
Use `? function_name` or explore the packages websites (in particular the Reference tab) to display it.

-   Run all the USMs defined in the `example` workspace (path stored in `workspace_path`). The path to JavaStics is stored in the `javastics_path` R object. This may take a few minutes: there many USMs!


```{r run_javaStics1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.timelimit=600}
# Insert your R code here!
```


```{r run_javaStics1-hint-1}
# No need to use the usm argument!
```

```{r run_javaStics1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
run_javastics(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path)
```

-   Run only the USMs banana and Turmeric.

```{r run_javaStics2, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r run_javaStics2-hint-1}
# Use the usm argument!
```

```{r run_javaStics2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
run_javastics(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("banana", "Turmeric"))
```


You can check that the corresponding STICS output files have been created in the folder `r workspace_path`.

:::

## Exploring and Evaluating the STICS results

### Getting simulations results

The `get_sim()` function can be used to get simulation results to R from a STICS workspace.
Some options allows filtering data, e.g. for given USM names or output variables.
Check the function help before trying to use it.

```{r prepare-get_sim}
usms <- get_usms_list(file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml"))
sim_done <- length(list.files(pattern = "^mod_s", workspace_path)) >=
  length(usms)

if (!sim_done) {
  print("Running simulations, please wait")
  run_javastics(
    javastics = javastics_path,
    workspace = workspace_path, verbose = FALSE
  )
}
```

-   Get the values of all the outputs simulated during the previous exercise in the `example` workspace

```{r get_sim1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim", exercise.timelimit=600}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_sim1-hint-1}
# The path of results is stored in the workspace_path object
```

```{r get_sim1-solution}
get_sim(workspace = workspace_path)
```

-   Get the values of the variable `lai_n` simulated for USMs `wheat` and `maize`

```{r get_sim4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim", exercise.timelimit=600}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_sim4-hint-1}
# The arguments usm and var are particularly useful in this case ...
```

```{r get_sim4-solution}
# SOLUTION
get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("wheat", "maize"), var = "lai_n")
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Further information about get_sim options:**

By default, each element (i.e. data.frame per USM) of the returned object by `get_sim()` contains a `Plant` column in which are stored either `"plant_1"` or `"plant_2"` indicating if the corresponding variable values concern the principal or associated crop in case of intercrop simulation.

If the `usms.xml` file path is given to the function, plant file names are set in the `Plant` column.
If both the `usms.xml` file path and the JavaStics path are given to the function, plant names are set in the `Plant` column and an additional column indicates those which correspond to a `Principal` or an `Associated` crop.
:::

### Data structures

The simulations (and observations) are stored using a `list` of `data.frame`s.
Each `data.frame` is used to store the data from a USM, with each row being a value for a given day and each column a variable (*e.g.* `lai_n`, the daily `lai`).

Each element (*i.e.* `data.frame`) of the `list` is named after the USM name.
So we can get the simulation results (or the observations) either by indexing the list with an integer value, or by using the `$` notation followed by the name of the USM, as you would do to get a variable with a `data.frame`.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Use the autocompletion from RStudio to get the USM name in the list.
The autocompletion is normally triggered whenever you start writing, but you can also force it by typing `ctrl+space` or `tab` after the `$` sign, e.g. `sim$` + `tab` on your keyboard would propose the USM names in the `sim` list.
:::

#### Finding data

Let's import some simulations for a few USMs and store them in an R object called `sim`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
usms <- c("wheat", "DurumWheat", "maize", "sorghum")
sim <- get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = usms)
```

```{r load-sim, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim"}
usms <- c("wheat", "DurumWheat", "maize", "sorghum")
sim <- get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = usms, verbose = FALSE)
sim_all <- CroPlotR::bind_rows(sim)
```

You can get the USMs names using the `names` function on the `sim` object:

```{r data_struct1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r data_struct1-hint-1}
# use the names function on the `sim` object
```

```{r data_struct1-solution}
# SOLUTION
names(sim)
```

The list of USMs is ordered, so we can index into it to get the simulation results.
Try to get the simulations results of the second USM using indexing (*e.g.* indexing on a vector is done using e.g. my_vec[1])

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Indexing into a list with `[` gives a subset of the list (it returns a list again), while indexing using `[[` gives you the values (the content) of the list at this index.
:::

```{r data_struct2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r data_struct2-hint-1}
# Index into the `sim` object using `[[`
```

```{r data_struct2-solution}
# SOLUTION
sim[[2]]
```

Ok now try to get the same USM results by using the `$` notation:

```{r data_struct3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r data_struct3-hint-1}
# Index into the `sim` object using `$` and the name of the USM: maize
```

```{r data_struct3-solution}
# SOLUTION
sim$maize
```

Finally, it is possible to chain the `$` notation or/and the indexing to get the values of the variables inside the `data.frame`.
For example all these notations are equivalent:

-   `sim$maize$lai_n`
-   `sim[[2]]$lai_n`
-   `sim[[2]][,2]`
-   `sim$maize[,2]`

#### 🔍 Manipulate data

Because the results are formatted as a list of `data.frame`s, we can use all the standard tools offered by *e.g.* the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

We can apply any function to each `data.frame` using the \*apply family of functions (*e.g.* lapply, mapply...).
For example if you want to get the maximum simulate LAI for each USM you would do:

```{r lapply_sim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
lapply(sim, function(x) max(x$lai_n))
```

An other way to do so is to first transform the list of `data.frame` into a single `data.frame`, and add a new column called situation that defines the USM for each row. CroPlotR provides its own version of `bind_rows` to do exactly that.

Use `CroPlotR::bind_rows` to make a single `data.frame` out of the list of `data.frame`s:

```{r data_struct4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r data_struct4-hint-1}
# Use `bind_rows` on `sim`
```

```{r data_struct4-solution}
# SOLUTION
CroPlotR::bind_rows(sim)
```

The resulting `data.frame` has a new column to keep track of which USM each row is from.

Now we can use the functions from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data wrangling and analysis.

For example we can use `filter` to filter the data:

```{r filter_sim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
sim_all <- CroPlotR::bind_rows(sim)

filter(sim_all, Date == as.POSIXct("2000-09-04", tz = "UTC"))
```

Or summarize it by group.
For exemple if we want the maximum lai for each USM (as we did above using `lapply`), we would do as follows:

```{r summarise_sim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "load-sim"}
sim_all %>%
  group_by(situation) %>%
  summarise(max_lai = max(lai_n))
```

### Plotting simulations results

The [CroPlotR](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroPlotR/) package can be used to plot simulated results as given by the `get_sim` function.

-   Use the values of the variables `lai_n` and `masec_n` simulated for USM `wheat` already stored in the `results` R object and plot their dynamics

```{r store-sim, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim"}
file_path <- file.path(tmp_dir, "sim-1.RData")
if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
  results <- get_sim(
    workspace = workspace_path, usm = "wheat",
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"), verbose = FALSE
  )

  save("results", file = file_path)
} else {
  load(file = file_path)
}
```

```{r plot_sim1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_sim1-hint-1}
# Use the results object containing get_sim output ...
```

```{r plot_sim1-hint-2}
# Then you can use the plot function as described in the CroPlotR documentation on the website <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/reference/plot.cropr_simulation.html> or from R using ?plot.cropr_simulation
```

```{r plot_sim1-solution}
# SOLUTION
p <- plot(results)
print(p)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that `?plot` does not refer to the `plot` function defined in CroPlotR.
To get the documentation about this function, either refer to the CroPlotR website or type `?plot.cropr_simulation`
:::

-   Then, do the same but plotting both variables on the same graph

```{r plot_sim2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_sim2-hint-1}
# Use the "overlap" argument ...
```

```{r plot_sim2-hint-2}
# try using : overlap = list(list("lai_n","masec_n"))
```

```{r plot_sim2-solution}
# SOLUTION
p <- plot(results, overlap = list(list("lai_n", "masec_n")))
print(p)
```

### Evaluating simulations results

Evaluation of simulation results is performed using observation data by plotting dynamic graphs, scatter plots and by calculating statistical criteria.
Observed data can be loaded by using the SticsRFiles `get_obs()` function and provided to CroPlotR functions.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
The data structure of the observations returned by `get_obs()` follow the same format than the simulations (*i.e.* `get_sim()` output).
It is a list of `data.frame`s named after the USM name.
Each row in the `data.frame` is a daily observation, and each columns is a variable.
All the manipulations presented on the `sim` object in the previous section are thus also applicable on the list returned by `get_obs()`.
:::

#### Getting observation data

-   Get all the observation data included in the `example` workspace (`workspace_path`)

```{r get_obs1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_obs1-hint-1}
# Path of the observation files is the same as this of simulations outputs
```

```{r get_obs1-solution}
# SOLUTION
get_obs(workspace = workspace_path)
```

-   Get observations of `lai_n` and `masec_n` variables for USMs `wheat` and `maize`

```{r get_obs2, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r get_obs2-hint-1}
# Use the same syntax as for the get_sim function
```

```{r get_obs2-solution}
# SOLUTION
get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("wheat", "maize"), var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"))
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Further information about get_obs options:** The get_obs function supports the same optional arguments: usms.xml file path, JavaStics file path for getting information about plant file or plant name for USMs.
Please refer to the `get_sim()` use section for details.
:::

#### Dynamic plots using observation data

As for the first exercise in the "Plotting simulations results" section, use the values of the variables `lai_n` and `masec_n` simulated for USM `wheat` stored in the `results2` object and plot their dynamics, but this time add the observation data to the plot using the values stored in the `observations2` object.

```{r store-sim-obs1, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim"}
file_path <- file.path(tmp_dir, "sim_obs1.RData")
if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
  results2 <- get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("wheat", "maize"), verbose = FALSE)
  observations2 <- get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("wheat", "maize"), verbose = FALSE)
  save(list = c("results2", "observations2"), file = file_path)
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file_path)
}
```

```{r plot_simobs1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs1"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_simobs1-hint-1}
# See previous exercises for dynamics plotting
```

```{r plot_simobs1-hint-2}
# Use the "obs" argument of the CroPlotR plot function
```

```{r plot_simobs1-solution}
# SOLUTION
p <- plot(results2, var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"), obs = observations2)
print(p)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that to plot some given variables, you can either filter their values when reading the results or when plotting them.
:::

#### Basic scatter plot

Scatter plots are used for displaying simulated values against observed values.
They can be produced using the same `plot()` function as for dynamics plots, with only changing the argument `type` of the `plot()` function.

-   Plot now the scatter plots of the simulated and observed values of `lai_n` and `masec_n` that are stored in the `results2` and `observations2` objects.

```{r plot_simobs2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs1"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_simobs2-hint-1}
# Try type = "scatter" ;-)
```

```{r plot_simobs2-solution}
# SOLUTION
p <- plot(results2, var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"), obs = observations2, type = "scatter")
print(p)
```

#### Customized scatter plots using symbols

The symbols used in the scatter plots can be adapted by the user using optional specific arguments, either to plot one symbol per USMs or per group of USMs.

-   Plot the same scatter plot as in the previous exercise, but with one symbol per USM

```{r plot_simobs3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs1"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_simobs3-hint-1}
# Look at the shape_sit argument ...
```

```{r plot_simobs3-solution}
# SOLUTION
p <- plot(results2, var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"), obs = observations2, type = "scatter", shape_sit = "symbol")
print(p)
```

-   Now, plot the scatter plot for the same variables `lai_n` and `masec_n` but for USMs "wheat","DurumWheat", "maize" and "sorghum", and with different symbols for the 2 groups c("wheat","DurumWheat") and c("maize","sorghum")

Use the R objects `results4` and `observations4` already containing respectively simulation outputs and observations for these USMs and variables.

```{r store-sim-obs2, exercise.setup = "prepare-get_sim"}
usms <- c("wheat", "DurumWheat", "maize", "sorghum")
file_path <- file.path(tmp_dir, "sim_obs2.RData")
if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
  results4 <- get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = usms, verbose = FALSE)
  observations4 <- get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = usms, verbose = FALSE)
  save(list = c("results4", "observations4"), file = file_path)
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file_path)
}
```

```{r plot_simobs4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_simobs4-hint-1}
# Set shape_sit = "group" and use the situation_group argument containing the groups definition (as a list of list)
```

```{r plot_simobs4-solution}
# SOLUTION
groups <- list(list("wheat", "DurumWheat"), list("maize", "sorghum"))
p <- plot(results4, var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"), obs = observations4, type = "scatter", shape_sit = "group", situation_group = groups)
print(p)
```

#### Statistics and associated graphs

The `summary()` function can be used for computing statistical criteria measuring the fit of simulations to observations.
These criteria can also be plotted using the `plot()` function.
As for the `plot()` function, to get the documentation about `summary()`, either refer to the CroPlotR website or type `?summary.cropr_simulation`.

##### Statistics criteria

<!--* Get the values of the variables `lai_n` and `masec_n` simulated and observed for USMs  `wheat`,`DurumWheat`, `maize`, and `sorghum` and compute the statistical criteria using the `summary()` function-->

-   Use the values of the variables `lai_n` and `masec_n` simulated and observed for USMs `wheat`,`DurumWheat`, `maize`, and `sorghum` from `results4` and `observations4`. Compute the statistical criteria using the `summary()` function

```{r stat_simobs1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stat_simobs1-hint-1}
# same use as for the plot function ...
```

```{r stat_simobs1-solution}
# SOLUTION
summary(results4, obs = observations4)
```

-   Now do the same but compute the statistical criteria per USM

```{r stat_simobs2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stat_simobs2-hint-1}
# use the argument all_situations ...
```

```{r stat_simobs2-solution}
# SOLUTION
summary(results4, obs = observations4, all_situations = FALSE)
```

```{=html}
<!-- note
la premiere colonne est perturbante Version 1
si 1 jeu de simulation: superflue !!
utile en cas de comparaison de 2 jeu de simulations

Si 2 jeux: plutôt que le nom de colonne == group, simu (pour les graphes scatter group == groupes d'usms !)
-->
```
```{=html}
<!-- !!!!! voir pour ajouter un cas ou on nomme le jeu de sim
pour retrouver le nom dans la colonne "group"
-->
```
##### 🔍 Statistics graphs

Statistical criteria can be plotted by providing the results of the `summary()` function to the `plot()` function.

For this purpose, the *R2* and *nRMSE* criteria will be used.

-   Plot the `R²` and `nRMSE` criteria computed on all the USMs in the previous exercise

```{r stat_simobs3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stat_simobs3-hint-1}
# Just use the object returned by the summary function in the plot function ...
```

```{r stat_simobs3-solution}
# SOLUTION
summ <- summary(results4, obs = observations4, stats = c("R2", "nRMSE"))

p <- plot(summ, title = "for all USMs")
print(p)
```

-   Now do the same but per USM

```{r stat_simobs4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stat_simobs4-hint-1}
# use the argument all_situations in summary ...
```

```{r stat_simobs4-solution}
# SOLUTION
summ <- summary(results4, obs = observations4, all_situations = FALSE, stats = c("R2", "nRMSE"))

p <- plot(summ, title = "for each USM")
print(p)
```

By default the results per USMs are plotted in bars having different columns

-   Now do the same but with USMs named in x axis

```{r stat_simobs5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-sim-obs2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stat_simobs5-hint-1}
# Use the xvar argument of plot ...
```

```{r stat_simobs5-solution}
# SOLUTION
summ <- summary(results4, obs = observations4, all_situations = FALSE, stats = c("R2", "nRMSE"))

p <- plot(summ, xvar = "situation", title = "USM names as X")
print(p)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
-   `summary()` and `plot()` functions can also be used to compare the results of different versions of simulated results (e.g. same USMs simulated with different versions of the model or different input parameters). See online documentation on [CroPlotR site](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/#223-statistics-plot) for more details.
-   When plotting the statistical criteria, it is important to select a (short) list of criteria to be plotted (and possibly of output variables) in order to ensure the readability of the graphs.

## Advanced use {#advanced-use}

You have learned so far how to use very useful but quite basic features of SticsRPacks packages.

Let's go now deeper into the packages functionalities.

## Generating JavaStics input Files

The different types of STICS input files can be generated using the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html).

### Generating observation files

Observation files can be generated from a data.frame using the function `gen_obs` of the [SticsRFiles package](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html).

They are not used by the STICS model but can be used to plot comparison between observed and simulated variables and to optimize STICS parameters both in JavaStics and in [CroPlotR](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/index.html) and [CroptimizR](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/index.html) packages as we have seen before.

-   Generate observation files from the data stored in the `df` data.frame using the `gen_obs` function and check their content using the `get_obs` function.

```{r gen_obs, exercise=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(usm_name = c("usm1", "usm1", "usm2"), ian = c(2020, 2021, 2021), mo = c(12, 7, 7), jo = c(25, 27, 20), jul = c(359, 573, 566), `lai_n` = c(0.5, 4.5, 4.2), mafruit = c(NA, 6.5, 6.1))

# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r gen_obs-hint-1}
# Use the out_path argument of get_obs if you want to specify the path of the folder where the obs files will be created.
# By default they are created in the current working directory of the R process (given by getwd()).
```

```{r gen_obs-hint-2}
# Use the workspace argument of get_obs to specify the path to the folder containing the observation files.
# if you did not use the out_path argument in gen_obs, then use workspace = getwd() in get_obs.
```

```{r gen_obs-solution}
# SOLUTION:
gen_obs(df = df, out_dir = getwd())
get_obs(workspace = getwd())
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that a subset of the observation files defined in the observation data.frame can be generated using the usm argument of gen_obs.

## Modifying JavaStics input files

[SticsRFiles](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/index.html) package also provides facilities for modifying JavaStics input files from R.

```{r set_param_xml-1, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the name of the SticsRFiles function for modifying JavaStics Input files (XML format)?",
  answer("set_param_xml", correct = TRUE),
  answer("set_param_txt"),
  answer("gen_usms_xml"),
  answer("gen_usms"),
  incorrect = "Look at the Reference tab of the SticsRFiles website...",
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

-   Check the values of the nitrification code (`codenitrif`) for the soils defined in the `sols.xml` file of the JavaStics distribution example workspace (path to the JavaStics distribution example workspace is stored in the R object `workspace_path`)

```{r set_param_xml-2, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r set_param_xml-2-hint-1}
# Use function get_param_xml
```

```{r set_param_xml-2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
get_param_xml(
  file = file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml"),
  param = "codenitrif"
)
```

-   Then, generate in the JavaStics distribution example workspace a new soil file called `sols_new.xml` for which all nitrification codes are set to 1 and check their values using the `get_param_xml` function.

```{r set_param_xml-3, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r set_param_xml-3-hint-1}
# Use function set_param_xml
```

```{r set_param_xml-3-solution}
# SOLUTION:
set_param_xml(
  file = file.path(workspace_path, "sols.xml"),
  param = "codenitrif", values = 1, save_as = file.path(workspace_path, "sols_new.xml")
)
get_param_xml(
  file = file.path(workspace_path, "sols_new.xml"),
  param = "codenitrif"
)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that STICS input files (txt format) can also be modified from R using the `set_param_txt()` function.

## Running simulations from R using stics_wrapper

### The need of a wrapper

We saw earlier how to run a simulation using `run_javastics()`.
This function simply calls JavaStics from the command line to run simulations.
This does the same as running an USM by opening the JavaStics user interface, but from R.

You are probably familiar with the xml files used as inputs for JavaStics (*e.g.* `sols.xml` or `usms.xml`).
These files define all the parameters values for one or several USMs, with potentially several soils, management practices and climate.
Then when we run a given USM, JavaStics reads the parameters values from the xml files, and writes new text files with only the values associated to this particular USM.
Then it calls the STICS model that reads those text files, runs the simulation, and writes the outputs.

So when we run a USM from JavaStics we have four different steps:

1.  JavaStics reads the parameters values for the USM from the xml files
2.  JavaStics writes text files with the parameters values that only describe this USM
3.  JavaStics calls the STICS model (*i.e* the STICS executable)
4.  the STICS model reads the parameters values from the text files, runs a simulation, and writes the output files (*i.e.* `mod_bXXX.sti` and `mod_sXXX.sti`)

This method is simpler for the user because it hides the technical details, but it has some downsides: it is slow because we have to create the text files each time we make a simulation, and we cannot parallelize the simulations because we share the same text files.

But no worries, SticsRPacks provides a solution to this!

Instead of creating the text files one USM at a time, we can create them for all USMs once into one folder for each, and then we directly call the STICS model (*i.e* without using JavaStics) on these files.
Using this method we are now able to run the simulations way faster, and in parallel!

So how do we do that?
Well, we use three steps:

-   create the text files (`gen_usms_xml2txt()`)
-   set-up our modeling environment (`stics_wrapper_options()`)
-   run the simulations and import the results (`stics_wrapper()`)

### Creating the text files

The first step is to create the text files for each USMs in a separate directory.
To do so, we will use the function `gen_usms_xml2txt()`.

Before generating the text files, we will first restrain the number of variables we want STICS to output using `gen_varmod`.

-   Use the `gen_varmod` function to tell STICS we only want to simulate "lai_n", "masec_n" and "mafruit"

```{r gen_varmod, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r gen_varmod-hint-1}
# Use `workspace_path = workspace_path`
```

```{r gen_varmod-solution}
# SOLUTION:
gen_varmod(workspace_path, var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"))
```

It is generally useful (although not mandatory) to pre-filter the variables to avoid filtering the variables for the wrapper, the plots and the statistics.

Now we can generate our text files.
Remember, the path of the JavaStics distribution downloaded by this tutorial is stored in the `javastics_path` R object, and the path to the example workspace in `workspace_path`.

-   Use the function `gen_usms_xml2txt()` to generate the text files for the USMs "wheat", "banana" and "soybean" in sub-folders of the `workspace_path` folder:

```{r gen_usms_xml2txt, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r gen_usms_xml2txt-hint-1}
# Use `javastics_path = javastics_path` and `workspace_path = workspace_path`
# No need to use the `target_path` argument here, it will be set by default to `workspace_path`
```

```{r gen_usms_xml2txt-solution}
# SOLUTION:
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usm = c("wheat", "banana", "soybean"))
```

The text files have been generated in subfolders of `workspace_path`, i.e. **`r workspace_path`**, one folder per USM, each taking the name of the corresponding USM.

```{r prepare-gen_usms}
# generate missing dirs, if any
dirs <- c("wheat", "banana", "soybean")
dirs_ex <- dir.exists(file.path(workspace_path, dirs))
if (!all(dirs_ex)) gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usm = dirs[!dirs_ex], verbose = FALSE)
```

Now, print the files inside the created folders:

```{r list_txt_files, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-gen_usms"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r list_txt_files-solution}
# SOLUTION:
dirs <- file.path(workspace_path, c("wheat", "banana", "soybean"))
list.files(dirs, full.names = TRUE)
```

### Setting-up the modeling environment

Before running the simulations using STICS, we have to define some information about our modeling environment.
This is done using `stics_wrapper_options()`.
This function, defined in SticsOnR, helps us define where is our installation of JavaStics, which STICS executable to use (*e.g.* if you are using an executable from a research branch), which workspace to use, etc...

-   Use `stics_wrapper_options()` to set-up our modeling environment using a parallel computation over the USMs for which we generated text files here-before:

```{r stics_wrapper_options1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stics_wrapper_options1-hint-1}
# Use `javastics = javastics_path` and `workspace = workspace_path`
# (remember, the folders including the text files for each USMs have been created in the folder workspace_path)
```

```{r stics_wrapper_options1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE)
```

### Running the simulations

Now everything is set-up to make our simulations!
The model options we will use here are stored in the `wrapper_options` object with the options we just set up in the previous section.

```{r store-wrapper-options, eval=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-gen_usms"}
wrapper_options_file <- file.path(tmp_dir, "wrapper_options.RData")
if (!file.exists(wrapper_options_file)) {
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  save(list = "wrapper_options", file = wrapper_options_file)
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = wrapper_options_file)
}
```

-   Now use `stics_wrapper()` to simulate leaf area index and above-ground biomass for the USM "wheat" only (not "banana" and "soybean") using the model options stored in `wrapper_options`, and print the results:

```{r stics_wrapper1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-wrapper-options"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stics_wrapper1-hint-1}
# The situation argument is used to choose the USMs to simulate.
```

```{r stics_wrapper1-hint-2}
# The var_names argument is used to choose the variables to return.
```

```{r stics_wrapper1-hint-3}
# Use get_var_info() to search for a variable name.
```

```{r stics_wrapper1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
res1 <- stics_wrapper(model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat", var = c("lai_n", "masec_n"))
print(res1)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
-   By default, if the `situation` argument is not given to `stics_wrapper()`, `stics_wrapper()` will run all the USMs defined in the sub-folders of the `workspace` folder (`workspace` is defined in `stics_wrapper_options()`).
-   By default, if the `var` argument is not given to `stics_wrapper()`, `stics_wrapper()` will return results for all the variables defined in the var.mod files included in the sub-folders of the `workspace` folder.
:::

### Data structure

The data structure returned by `stics_wrapper` is a list of two:

-   `error`: `TRUE` if there was an error during the simulation, `FALSE` otherwise
-   `sim_list`: a list of the simulation results

The content of `sim_list` follows the same format as the outputs returned by `get_obs` and `get_sim`: it is a list of `data.frame`s.
Each `data.frame` corresponds to the simulation results of a USM, with each row being a value for a given day, and each column a variable.
The data can be accessed using indexing or the `$` syntax, *i.e.*: `res$sim_list$wheat` would return a `data.frame` with the simulation results for the USM called "wheat".

### Parameter forcing

Sometimes it is useful to compare the outputs of the model with a different value for one or several parameters to better understand its impact or check if it is used.

`stics_wrapper()` provides an easy way to do so with the `param_values` argument.
This argument is given as a named vector.

-   Make a simulation on the "wheat" USM and output just the lai, but this time with `dlaimax = 0.005` and `durvieF = 80`:

```{r stics_wrapper2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-wrapper-options"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stics_wrapper2-hint-1}
# `param_values` is given as a named vector, e.g. c("bdens" = 5, "hautmax" = 1.1)
```

```{r stics_wrapper2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
res2 <- stics_wrapper(model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat", var = "lai_n", param_values = c("dlaimax" = 0.005, "durvieF" = 80))
print(res2)
```

### Plot the comparison

Now we can plot the outputs of the two simulations using the CroPlotR `plot()` function.
The results of both simulations are accessible in the `res1` and `res2` objects.
Remember, the simulated variables values are stored in the `sim_list` field of each object.
For example, to get the values of the simulated variables for `res1`, we would do: `res1$sim_list`.

```{r store-comp_res, exercise.setup = "prepare-gen_usms"}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "comp_res.RData"))) {
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
    javastics = javastics_path,
    workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE,
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  res1 <- stics_wrapper(
    model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat",
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n")
  )
  res2 <- stics_wrapper(
    model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat",
    var = "lai_n",
    param_values = c("dlaimax" = 0.005, "durvieF" = 80)
  )

  save(list = c("res1", "res2"), file = file.path(tmp_dir, "comp_res.RData"))
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "comp_res.RData"))
}
```

Then, to plot a simulation result, we would do:

```{r stics_wrapper-plot-ex, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-comp_res"}
# Execute the code below to create a plot of the results:
p <- plot(res1$sim_list)
print(p)
```

It is also possible to compare the results of several simulations by giving them as arguments to the function one after the other.

-   Plot the comparison between the outputs of both simulations:

```{r stics_wrapper-plot1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-comp_res"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stics_wrapper-plot1-hint-1}
# The simulation results can be listed one after the other in `plot()` for comparison
```

```{r stics_wrapper-plot1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(res1$sim_list, res2$sim_list)
print(p)
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Only the `lai` variable was requested on the second simulation, that's why there is only the results of the first simulation for masec.
:::

We can also name the simulations in our plot by naming them when passed as arguments to `plot()`.

-   Plot the comparison between the outputs of both simulations, and name the first simulation "original" and the second simulation "dlaimax=0.005, durvieF=80":

```{r stics_wrapper-plot2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-comp_res"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r stics_wrapper-plot2-hint-1}
# Name the arguments of the plot function, e.g. plot("sim1" = res1) would name the simulation "sim1" (but would not output it on the plot because there is only one)
```

```{r stics_wrapper-plot2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot("original" = res1$sim_list, "dlaimax=0.005, durvieF=80" = res2$sim_list)
print(p)
```

## Estimating parameters

### Workflow

Model calibration is an important part of most modeling work, but it can be complex and cumbersome.
SticsRPacks provides a nice, standardized and easy way to estimate the values of parameters using observations through the CroptimizR `estim_param()` function.

The workflow for parameter estimation is made using several steps:

-   Modeling environment set-up (`stics_wrapper_options()`). `estim_param()` uses `stics_wrapper()` under the hood to run each simulation, so we must set-up our modeling environment first as we saw before.
-   Import the observations for each USM (`get_obs()` + `filter_obs()`).
-   Choose the parameter(s) to optimize and their boundary values.
-   Set-up options for the optimization method,
-   run the parameter optimization (`estim_param`).

```{r store-param-estim, exercise.setup = "prepare-gen_usms"}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "store-param-estim.RData"))) {
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
  obs <- get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = "wheat", verbose = FALSE)
  obs_filt <- filter_obs(obs, "lai_n", include = TRUE)
  param_info <- list(stamflax = list(lb = 200, ub = 400))
  optim_options <- list(nb_rep = 3, maxeval = 10, xtol_rel = 1e-03, out_dir = workspace_path, ranseed = 1234)

  save(
    list = c("wrapper_options", "obs", "obs_filt", "param_info", "optim_options"),
    file = file.path(tmp_dir, "store-param-estim.RData")
  )
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "store-param-estim.RData"))
}
```


### Modelling environment

We will simply re-use the modeling environment from the previous exercise: `wrapper_options`.
This is how we did it:

``` {.r}
wrapper_options = stics_wrapper_options(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE)
```

### Observations

-   Import the observations for the "wheat" USM, and put it in an object called `obs`:

```{r estim_param_obs1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param_obs1-hint-1}
# Use `get_obs()`, workspace_path is the workspace.
```

```{r estim_param_obs1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
obs <- get_obs(workspace = workspace_path, usm = "wheat")
```

-   Filter the observations to get only the lai using `filter_obs()`, and put it in an object called `obs_filt`:

```{r estim_param_obs2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param_obs2-hint-1}
# Use the argument var_names in filter_obs ...
```

```{r estim_param_obs2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
obs_filt <- filter_obs(obs, "lai_n", include = TRUE)
```

### Parameters of the optimization method

The optimization methods available in CroptimizR have some parameters too.
For example the simplex method has the following:

-   `nb_rep`: Number of times the minimization process is done, each time starting with a different set of initial parameters values. This one is used to control whether our initial values impact our resulting optimized value or not. The more is better, but the whole optimization process is repeated `nb_rep` so it takes more and more time.
-   `maxeval`: Maximum number of evaluations of the minimized criteria. That is to say the algorithm is stopped if it did not converge to a value after `maxeval` runs.
-   `xtol_rel`: Tolerance criterion between two iterations, *i.e.* stop the algorithm when an optimization step (or an estimate of the optimum) changes every parameter by less than xtol_rel multiplied by the absolute value of the parameter.
-   `out_dir`: path to the directory on which the results will be written (graph and .Rdata)
-   `ranseed`: set the random seed so that each execution give the same results. If you want full randomization, don't set it.

Only `out_dir` is mandatory, all the others have default values.

::: {.alert .alert-note}
More information can be found on the CroptimizR vignettes, e.g. [here](https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_simple_case.html).
:::

These parameters are passed to `estim_param` as a named list.

-   Make a named list to set values for these parameters and put the results in an object named `optim_options`. We require 3 repetitions and maxeval=10 (to make it quick ... in real life you should set maxeval to a large value to let the process converge). You can use any directory to store the results. If you don't particularly care where to put them, you can put them in `workspace_path`.

```{r estim_param_options, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param_options-hint-1}
# A name list is constructed like so: list(name1 = value1, name2 = value2)
```

```{r estim_param_options-solution}
# SOLUTION:
optim_options <- list(nb_rep = 3, maxeval = 10, out_dir = workspace_path)
```

### Choose parameter

We have to choose which parameter will be optimized, and what are their respective boundary values.
To do so, we define a list of list for each parameter like so:

``` {.r}
param_info = list()
param_info$dlaimax = list(lb = 0.0005, ub = 0.0025)
param_info$durvieF = list(lb = 100, ub = 450)
```

::: {.alert .alert-note}
You can get more information about parameters using `get_param_info`.
:::

Let's try to optimize the value of the `stamflax` parameter.

-   Create the parameter list for `stamflax` and name it `param_info`.

```{r estim_param_param, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param_param-hint-1}
# You can use 200 and 400 for boundary values
```

```{r estim_param_param-solution}
# SOLUTION:
param_info <- list(stamflax = list(lb = 200, ub = 400))
```

### Optimization

Now that we defined all information we needed, we can use `estim_param()` to make the optimization.

As a reminder, here's the objects we previously defined:

-   `obs_filt`: the observations to use in the optimization

-   `stics_wrapper`: this is the wrapper function for stics

-   `wrapper_options`: the options passed to `stics_wrapper`

-   `optim_options`: the parameters for the optimization method

-   `param_info`: the parameter(s) names and boundary values

-   Now estimate the value of `stamflax` using `estim_param()` and the previous objects we defined, and put the results in an object called `optim_res`.

```{r estim_param2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim", exercise.timelimit=600}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param2-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of estim_param() and associate the aforementioned objects to the corresponding arguments.
```

```{r estim_param2-solution}
# SOLUTION:
optim_res <- estim_param(
  obs_list = obs_filt,
  model_function = stics_wrapper,
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  optim_options = optim_options,
  param_info = param_info
)
```

::: {.alert .alert-note}
The optimization process can take a while.
Time to drink a ☕ maybe!

If you don't want to wait for the optimization process, we got you covered.
You can still continue to the next exercises because we cached the output for you (we stored the result of `estim_param()` in the object `optim_res`, but running it with the default value of `maxeval`).
:::

::: {.alert .alert-info}
-   The default parameter estimation method used in `estim_param()` is the minimization of a least square criterion using the Nelder-Mead simplex.
However, different methods and criteria can be used.
Look [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Available_parameter_estimation_algorithms.html) for more details about the available methods and criteria.

-   The results provided by `estim_param()` depend on the method used.
Graphs and .Rdata produced are stored in `optim_options$out_dir`.
`estim_param()` also displays some results on the standard output (see here-before) and returns a list including the main results (stored here in the `optim_res` object).
In the case of the simplex method this list includes:

-   the values of the estimated parameters (`final_values`),
-   the initial values used for each repetition (`init_values`),
-   the optimized value of the criterion for each repetition (`crit_values`),
-   ...

-   The `info_level` argument of `estim_param` allows to control the quantity of information returned and stored (see `? estim_param` for more details).

```{r store-param-estim-out, exercise.setup="prepare-gen_usms"}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-param-estim-out.RData"))) {
  load(file = system.file("extdata/optim_results.Rdata", package = "SticsRPacks"))
  optim_res <- res
  rm(res)
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
    javastics = javastics_path,
    workspace = workspace_path, parallel = TRUE,

  )
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-param-estim-out.RData"))
}
```

### Plots

Now that our parameter value is optimized, we can re-run the model with this value to check the results.
To do so, we call again `stics_wrapper` with the optimized value passed as argument.

-   Use `stics_wrapper` to make a new simulation of the `wheat` USM with our optimized value `optim_res$final_values`, and store the simulated results (i.e. the content of `sim_list`) in an object called `sim_after_optim`.

```{r estim_param3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param3-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of stics_wrapper() and use the `param_values` argument along with the resulting optimized value stored in `optim_res$final_values`.
```

```{r estim_param3-hint-2}
# Use the situation argument of stics_wrapper() to select the USM to simulate.
```

```{r estim_param3-hint-3}
# stics_wrapper() returns a list of two:
# - sim_list for the results
# - error for indications on errors
# We need only the results in our object `sim_after_optim`.
```

```{r estim_param3-solution}
# SOLUTION:
sim_after_optim <- stics_wrapper(param_values = optim_res$final_values, model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat")$sim_list
```

Now we can plot the output using `plot()`.

-   Use `plot()` to make a dynamic plot of the simulations along with the observations (`obs_filt`) for the `lai_n` variable.

```{r estim_param4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param4-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of plot(). This one is tricky, you can either see it on the package website <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/reference/plot.cropr_simulation.html> or from R using ?plot.cropr_simulation
```

```{r estim_param4-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(sim = sim_after_optim, obs = obs_filt, var = "lai_n")
print(p)
```

We can also make a scatter plot for a different display of the fit between observations and simulations.

-   Make the same plot but as a scatter plot instead of a dynamic plot

```{r estim_param5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param5-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of plot(). This one is tricky, you can either see it on the package website <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/reference/plot.cropr_simulation.html> or from R using ?plot.cropr_simulation
```

```{r estim_param5-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(sim = sim_after_optim, obs = obs_filt, type = "scatter", var = "lai_n")
print(p)
```

### Before/after comparison

It is often interesting to compare the simulations before and after the optimization to investigate if it worked properly.
To do so, we just have to simulate both, and to plot the results using `plot()`.

-   Make a simulation using `stics_wrapper` with the original values of the parameters, and store the simulated results (i.e. the content of `sim_list`) in an object called `sim_before_optim`.

```{r estim_param6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param6-hint-1}
# estim_param() does not modify the input files, so you can just re-simulate the USM "wheat" with stics_wrapper
```

```{r estim_param6-solution}
# SOLUTION:
sim_before_optim <- stics_wrapper(model_options = wrapper_options, situation = "wheat")$sim_list
```

Now we can compare the simulations using `plot()` and `summary()`.

-   Make a plot to compare both simulations for `lai_n`

```{r estim_param7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param7-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of plot(). This one is trick, you can either see it on the package website <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/reference/plot.cropr_simulation.html> or from R using ?plot.cropr_simulation
```

```{r estim_param7-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(before_optim = sim_before_optim, after_optim = sim_after_optim, obs = obs_filt, var = "lai_n")
print(p)
```

-   Compute the nRMSE and Bias of both simulations for `lai_n` using `summary()`

```{r estim_param8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-param-estim-out"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r estim_param8-hint-1}
# Read the documentation of summary(). This one is trick, you can either see it on the package website <https://SticsRPacks.github.io/CroPlotR/reference/summary.cropr_simulation.html> or from R using ?summary.cropr_simulation
```

```{r estim_param8-hint-2}
# use the "stat" argument of summary to select the criteria to compute ...
```

```{r estim_param8-solution}
# SOLUTION:
summary(before_optim = sim_before_optim, after_optim = sim_after_optim, obs = obs_filt, stats = c("nRMSE", "Bias"))
```

## Managing successive USMs

In STICS, USMs can be run successively so that soil and plant initial conditions of a USM are defined from the state of soil and plant as simulated on a preceding USM.
This is for example very useful to simulated crop rotations.
For that, starting and ending dates of simulations for the different successive USMs must be adequately defined (if USM1 ends at day d_end1, USM2 must start at day d_end1+1 ... see STICS documentation for more details).

### Simulating successive crops

The `run_javastics` function CAN NOT be used to run successive USMs.
In this case, it is advised to use the `stics_wrapper()` function.

-   Have a look at the argument `successive_usms` of the function `stics_wrapper_options()`. Then, simulate USMs `demo_Wheat1`, `demo_BareSoil2`and `demo_maize3` (defined in the JavaStics distribution example workspace) both in independent and successive ways using `stics_wrapper`. Check that the last values of the simulated mafruit for `demo_maize3` differ between the two different simulation modes (independent or successive USMs).

```{r sim_successive, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r sim_successive-hint-1}
# First generate the txt files using gen_usms_xml2txt
```

```{r sim_successive-hint-2}
# successive_usms argument must be a list of vectors of successive USMs,
# thus in this case list(c("demo_Wheat1","demo_BareSoil2","demo_maize3"))
```

```{r sim_successive-hint-3}
# Use the tail function with argument n=1 to extract the last element of a vector.
```

```{r sim_successive-solution}
# SOLUTION:

# Generate the txt files
gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path, usm = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"))

# Run without succession
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
  javastics = javastics_path,
  workspace = workspace_path
)
without_succ <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  situation = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3")
)

# Run with succession
wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
  javastics = javastics_path,
  workspace = workspace_path,
  successive = list(c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"))
)
with_succ <- stics_wrapper(
  model_options = wrapper_options,
  situation = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3")
)

# Compare both
print(paste(
  "mafruit demo_maize3 without succession:",
  tail(without_succ$sim_list$demo_maize3$mafruit, n = 1)
))
print(paste(
  "mafruit demo_maize3 with succession:",
  tail(with_succ$sim_list$demo_maize3$mafruit, n = 1)
))
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Successive USMs can also be simulated using the `run_stics` function.
This is however a bit more complex since the user has in this case to explicitly handle the succession by:

i)  Calling `run_stics` for each USM to simulate ;
ii) Between two calls to `run_stics`, copying the files `recup.tmp` and `snow_variables.txt` generated in the folder of the preceding USMs to the folder of the USMs to simulate
iii) Defining the `codesuite` parameter to 1 in the file `travail.usm` of the USM to simulate

It can however be useful if one want for example to include decision rules between the successive USMs to simulate.
:::

### Plotting successive simulations

Dynamic plots of variables can be aggregated to generate continuous plots.

-   Have a look at the argument `successive` of the `plot` function of the CroPlotR package. Then plot the `azomes` variable (amount of NO3-N in soil) simulated in the previous exercise for both modes (use the `without_succ` and `with_succ` R variables that contains the results returned by the wrapper, as presented in the SOLUTION of the previous exercise). Check that `azomes` is more continuous in the second case.

```{r prepare-plot-successive}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-plot-successive.RData"))) {
  gen_usms_xml2txt(javastics_path, workspace_path,
    usm = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"),
    verbose = FALSE
  )

  # Run without succession
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
    javastics = javastics_path,
    workspace = workspace_path,
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  without_succ <- stics_wrapper(
    model_options = wrapper_options,
    situation = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"),
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit", "azomes")
  )

  # Run with succession
  wrapper_options <- stics_wrapper_options(
    javastics = javastics_path,
    workspace = workspace_path,
    successive = list(c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3")),
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  with_succ <- stics_wrapper(
    model_options = wrapper_options,
    situation = c("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"),
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit", "azomes")
  )

  save(
    list = c("without_succ", "with_succ"),
    file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-plot-successive.RData")
  )
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-plot-successive.RData"))
}
```

```{r plot_successive, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-plot-successive", exercise.lines=8}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r plot_successive-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(
  "Without successive" = without_succ$sim_list,
  "With successive" = with_succ$sim_list,
  var = "azomes",
  successive = list(list("demo_Wheat1", "demo_BareSoil2", "demo_maize3"))
)
print(p)
```

### Estimating parameters on successive simulations

Estimating parameters on successive simulations is also possible.
Actually it may not require specific options in the `estim_param` function: if the `successive_usms` argument is defined in the STICS wrapper options, then the parameters will be estimated on successive simulations.

Note however that by default the same values of the parameters will be applied on all USMs.
If one want to estimate the parameters for specific USMs only, or with different values depending on the USMs, one must use the `sit_list` element of the `param_info` argument.

## Managing Intercrops

We will see in this section how intercrops are handled in SticsRPacks.

-   Run the "intercrop_pea_barley" USM of the JavaStics distribution example workspace from R, get the results of lai_n, masec_n and mafruit for both crops and store them in an R object called `sim` (path to JavaStics is stored in the `javastics_path` R object and path to the example workspace is stored in `workspace_path`)

```{r intercrop-1, exercise=TRUE}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r intercrop-1-hint-1}
# Use the run_javastics function with the usm argument to run the intercrop_pea_barley USM ...
```

```{r intercrop-1-hint-2}
# Use the get_sim function with the usm and var arguments to get the required results.
```

```{r intercrop-1-solution}
# SOLUTION:
run_javastics(javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path, usm = c("intercrop_pea_barley"))
sim <- get_sim(workspace = workspace_path, usm = "intercrop_pea_barley", var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"))
```

-   Examine the results and try to answer the quizz below

```{r run-intercrop, eval=FALSE}
if (!all(file.exists(file.path(workspace_path, c(
  "mod_spintercrop_pea_barley.sti",
  "mod_saintercrop_pea_barley.sti"
))))) {
  run_javastics(
    javastics = javastics_path, workspace = workspace_path,
    usm = c("intercrop_pea_barley"), verbose = FALSE
  )
}
```

```{r store-intercrop-2, exercise.setup = "run-intercrop"}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-2.RData"))) {
  sim <- get_sim(
    workspace = workspace_path,
    usm = "intercrop_pea_barley",
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"), verbose = FALSE
  )

  save(
    list = c("sim"),
    file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-2.RData")
  )
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-2.RData"))
}
```

```{r intercrop-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-intercrop-2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r intercrop-2-hint-1}
# You just have to print sim ...
```

```{r intercrop-2-solution}
print(sim)
```

```{r intercrop-3, echo=FALSE}
question("How are organized the results for the different intercrops",
  answer("In a single data.frame per USM, the results for the different crops being flagged by Plant and Dominance columns", correct = TRUE),
  answer("In different data.frames, depending on the crop"),
  incorrect = "You're not lucky ... the correct proposition is the other one!",
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

-   Check now how results are changed when you use the `usms_file` argument of the `get_sim` function

```{r intercrop-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-intercrop-2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r intercrop-4-solution}
# SOLUTION:
sim <- get_sim(
  workspace = workspace_path, usm = "intercrop_pea_barley",
  var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"),
  usms_file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml")
)
print(sim)
# The names of the Plant files are now given in the Plant column instead of Plant_1 and Plant_2 ...
```

-   And, finally, how results are changed when you use in addition the `javastics_path` argument of the `get_sim` function

```{r intercrop-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-intercrop-2"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r intercrop-5-solution}
# SOLUTION:
sim <- get_sim(
  workspace = workspace_path, usm = "intercrop_pea_barley",
  var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"),
  usms_file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml"), javastics = javastics_path
)
print(sim)
# The names of the Plants are now given in the Plant column.
```

-   Now, plot the simulation results using the standard plot function of CroPlotR

```{r store-intercrop-6, exercise.setup = "run-intercrop"}
if (!file.exists(file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-6.RData"))) {
  sim <- get_sim(
    workspace = workspace_path, usm = "intercrop_pea_barley",
    var = c("lai_n", "masec_n", "mafruit"),
    usms_file = file.path(workspace_path, "usms.xml"), javastics = javastics_path,
    verbose = FALSE
  )

  save(
    list = c("sim"),
    file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-6.RData")
  )
} else {
  # print("loading")
  load(file = file.path(tmp_dir, "prepare-intercrop-6.RData"))
}
```

```{r intercrop-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "store-intercrop-6"}
# Insert your R code here!
```

```{r intercrop-6-solution}
# SOLUTION:
p <- plot(sim)
print(p)
```

## Advanced parameter estimation

Note that many features are available for parameter estimation in CroptimizR.
This is not the sake of this tutorial to present all of them.
They are detailed either in the `estim_param` function documentation and/or in the CroptimizR vignettes.

Among them you will find:

-   the use of inequality constraints between parameters (see argument `satisfy_par_const`),
-   the simultaneous estimation of different values of the same parameters depending on the USMs (use of `sit_list`in `param_info` argument, see (here)[<https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_Specific_and_Varietal.html>] for a detailed example),
-   the use of bayesian methods (see (here)[<https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Parameter_estimation_DREAM.html>] for a detailed example)
-   the possibility to dynamically transform simulations and/or observations in case observed values do not directly correspond to simulated variables (see arguments `transform_obs`, `transform_sim` and `var_names`)
-   ...
