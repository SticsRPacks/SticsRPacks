## Overview

SticsRPacks is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The __SticsRPacks__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from SticsRPacks in a single command.

If you'd like to learn how to use the SticsRPacks packages, the best place to start are the vignettes that come along the packages, and also available from each websites (Article sections).

> This package is heavily inspired from the tidyverse [package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from GitHub
# install devtools if not yet installed : install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

It this does not work, follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/issues/1#event-2864068985).

## Usage

`library(SticsRPacks)` will load the core SticsRPacks packages: 

* [SticsRFiles](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles), for files manipulation.  
* [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR), for STICS simulation management.  
* [CroPlotR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroPlotR), for plotting and statistics.  
* [CroptimizR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR), for parameter optimization.  

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(SticsRPacks)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `SticsRPacks_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
SticsRPacks_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all SticsRPacks packages are up-to-date with `SticsRPacks_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
SticsRPacks_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * SticsRFiles (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * CroptimizR (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```


## Tutorial

**A tutorial is provided to learn how to use the main features of the SticsRPacks packages!**

To run it you need to install the `learnr` package.

Then, if you have RStudio version 1.3 or greater, click on the Tutorial pane on the right of the RStudio window (close to Environment, History, ... panes), scroll to see `Tutorial for SticsRPacks` and click on the button `Start Tutorial`.

Alternatively, e.g. if you have an older version of RStudio or if you don't have the Tutorial pane for any reason, you can run the tutorial by running the command:
`learnr::run_tutorial("SticsRpacks", package="SticsRPacks")`

The first time it is started the tutorial takes a few minutes to initialize in order to download all the materials and run the solutions. Subsequent runs do not need this steps, the tutorial will thus start almost immediately from the second run.
