## Overview

SticsRPacks is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The __SticsRPacks__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from SticsRPacks in a single command.

If you'd like to learn how to use the SticsRPacks packages, the best place to start are the vignettes that come along the packages, and also available from each websites (Article sections).

> This package is heavily inspired from the tidyverse [package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# # Install from CRAN
# install.packages("SticsRPacks")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

It this does not work, follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/issues/1#event-2864068985).

## Usage

`library(SticsRPacks)` will load the core SticsRPacks packages: 

* [SticsRFiles](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles), for files manipulation.  
* [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR), for STICS simulation management.  
* [CroPlotR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroPlotR), for plotting and statistics.  
* [CroptimizR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR), for parameter optimization.  

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(SticsRPacks)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `SticsRPacks_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
SticsRPacks_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all SticsRPacks packages are up-to-date with `SticsRPacks_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
SticsRPacks_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * SticsRFiles (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * CroptimizR (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
