## Overview

SticsRPacks is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share
common data representations and API design. The **SticsRPacks** package
is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from
SticsRPacks in a single command.

If youâ€™d like to learn how to use the SticsRPacks packages, the best
place to start are the vignettes that come along the packages, and also
available from each websites (Article sections).

> This package is heavily inspired from the tidyverse
> [package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).

## Installation

Get first the default path of installation of R packages on your computer by executing the command `.libPaths()` in the R console.
If the returned path does not include any space (e.g. "/path/of/installation/of/r/packages" and not "/path of installation/of/r/packages"), you can proceed to the installation of SticsRPacks using the following command:

``` r
# Install from GitHub
# install devtools if not yet installed : install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

If the returned path includes at least one space, it is strongly advised to install SticsRPacks in another folder which path does not include any space, by using the command:
``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks", lib="/the/path/of/your/choice")
```

It the installation does not work, follow the instructions given
[here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/issues/1#event-2864068985).


## Usage

`library(SticsRPacks)` (or `library(SticsRPacks, lib="/the/path/of/your/choice")` if you redefined the installation path) will load the core SticsRPacks packages:

-   [SticsRFiles](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles), for files
    manipulation.  
-   [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR), for STICS
    simulation management.  
-   [CroPlotR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroPlotR), for plotting
    and statistics.  
-   [CroptimizR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR), for
    parameter optimization.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you
have loaded:

``` r
library(SticsRPacks)
#> -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------- SticsRPacks 0.2.0 --
#> v SticsRFiles 0.3.0     v SticsOnR    0.2.1
#> v CroptimizR  0.3.0     v CroPlotR    0.7.0
#> 
```

You can see conflicts created later with `SticsRPacks_conflicts()`:

``` r
library(MASS)
SticsRPacks_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all SticsRPacks packages are up-to-date with
`SticsRPacks_update()`:

``` r
SticsRPacks_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * SticsRFiles (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * CroptimizR (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
