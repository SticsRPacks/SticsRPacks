## Overview

SticsRPacks is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share
common data representations and API design. The **SticsRPacks** package
is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from
SticsRPacks in a single command.

If you’d like to learn how to use the SticsRPacks packages, the best
place to start are the vignettes that come along the packages, and also
available from each websites (Article sections).

> This package is heavily inspired from the tidyverse
> [package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).

## Installation

The installation requires the devtools package. If it is not yet
installed, run first `install.packages("devtools")`.

Then, you can install the SticsRPacks packages by running:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks@*release")
```

## Troubleshooting

It the installation does not work:

- In case you have messages such as:

  - “cannot remove prior installation of package ‘\*\*\*\*\*’”

  or

  - API rate limit exceeded for \*\*\*\*

  please refer to
  [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/documentation/blob/master/github_install.md).

- otherwise, please follow the instructions given
  [here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/issues/1#event-2864068985).

## Usage

`library(SticsRPacks)` will load the core SticsRPacks packages:

- [SticsRFiles](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles), for files
  manipulation.  
- [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR), for STICS
  simulation management.  
- [CroPlotR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroPlotR), for plotting and
  statistics.  
- [CroptimizR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR), for parameter
  optimization.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you
have loaded:

``` r
library(SticsRPacks)
#> ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────── SticsRPacks 0.7.1 ──
#> ✔ SticsRFiles 1.5.0      ✔ SticsOnR    1.2.0 
#> ✔ CroptimizR  0.6.1      ✔ CroPlotR    0.10.0
#> ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────────────────── SticsRPacks_conflicts() ──
#> ✖ CroptimizR::AIC()    masks stats::AIC()
#> ✖ CroptimizR::BIC()    masks stats::BIC()
#> ✖ methods::body<-()    masks base::body<-()
#> ✖ methods::kronecker() masks base::kronecker()
```

You can see conflicts created later with `SticsRPacks_conflicts()`:

``` r
library(MASS)
SticsRPacks_conflicts()
#> ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────────────────── SticsRPacks_conflicts() ──
#> ✖ CroptimizR::AIC()    masks stats::AIC()
#> ✖ CroptimizR::BIC()    masks stats::BIC()
#> ✖ methods::body<-()    masks base::body<-()
#> ✖ methods::kronecker() masks base::kronecker()
```

And you can check that all SticsRPacks packages are up-to-date with
`SticsRPacks_update()`:

``` r
SticsRPacks_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * SticsRFiles (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * CroptimizR (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```

## Tutorial

**A tutorial is provided to learn how to use the main features of the
SticsRPacks packages!**

To run it you need to install the `learnr` package.

If you have a version of STICS more recent or equal to 9.2.0 installed
on your computer, it is recommended that you use this version to carry
out the exercises of the tutorial.

For this, an environment variable `javastics_path` must be set to the
path of the corresponding JavaSTICS folder. This can be done:

- in your R session, each time before running the tutorial, by executing
  the following command:
  `Sys.setenv(javastics_path="path_to_JavaSTICS")`, where
  `path_to_JavaSTICS` should be replaced by the absolute path of the
  corresponding JavaSTICS folder.

or

- by defining this environment variable in your .Renviron file: edit
  this file (located in your Home directory, can be edited also using
  `usethis::edit_r_environ()`), and add a new line
  `javastics_path="path_to_JavaSTICS"`. In this case, your R session
  must then be restarted (in RStudio: menu Session-\> Restart R).

Then, if you have RStudio version 1.3 or greater, click on the Tutorial
pane on the right of the RStudio window (close to Environment, History,
… panes), scroll to see `Tutorial for SticsRPacks` and click on the
button `Start Tutorial`.

Alternatively, e.g. if you have an older version of RStudio or if you
don’t have the Tutorial pane for any reason, you can run the tutorial by
running the command:
`learnr::run_tutorial("SticsRpacks", package="SticsRPacks")`

The first time it is started, the tutorial takes a few minutes to
initialize in order to download all the materials and run the solutions.
Subsequent runs do not need this steps, the tutorial will thus start
almost immediately from the second run.

**NEWS: the tutorial can now be done online, without installing
SticsRPacks: just by clicking
