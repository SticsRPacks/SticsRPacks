## Overview

SticsRPacks is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share
common data representations and API design. The **SticsRPacks** package
is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from
SticsRPacks in a single command.

If youâ€™d like to learn how to use the SticsRPacks packages, the best
place to start are the vignettes that come along the packages, and also
available from each websites (Article sections).

> This package is heavily inspired from the tidyverse
> [package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).

## Installation

``` r
# # Install from CRAN
# install.packages("SticsRPacks")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

It this does not work, follow the instructions given
[here](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks/issues/1#event-2864068985).

## Usage

`library(SticsRPacks)` will load the core SticsRPacks packages:

  - [SticsRFiles](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles), for files
    manipulation.  
  - [SticsOnR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/SticsOnR), for STICS
    simulation management.  
  - [CroptimizR](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroptimizR), for
    parameter optimisation.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you
have loaded:

``` r
library(SticsRPacks)
#> -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------ SticsRPacks 0.0.1.9000 --
#> <U+2713> SticsRFiles   0.0.0.9000     <U+2713> SticsOnR      0.0.0.9000
#> <U+2713> CroptimizR 0.0.0.9000
#> 
```

You can see conflicts created later with `SticsRPacks_conflicts()`:

``` r
library(MASS)
#> Warning: package 'MASS' was built under R version 3.5.1
SticsRPacks_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all SticsRPacks packages are up-to-date with
`SticsRPacks_update()`:

``` r
SticsRPacks_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * SticsRFiles (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * CroptimizR (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
